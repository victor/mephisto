= Installation

See public/install.html for setup instructions.

= Timezones

You MUST export the environment variable TZ=UTC, or else the article dates
and times will be invalid.

This would not be needed if rails used UTC for everything, but
unfortunately it doesn't... eg: action_view/helpers/date_helper.rb uses
Time::now instead of Timer::now.utc, and Time::mktime instead of
Time::utc.

XXX oh, we can't depend on the rails helpers at all, because they don't
    translate the time from UTC (assuming the TZ env var is correctly
    set) to site time, you've to roll our own, or monkey patch rails :/

= Dependencies

Note that Mephisto depends on fewer gems when RAILS_ENV=production than it
does in a development environment.

Run 'rake gems:install' to install the development gems.  In a production
environment, run:

  RAILS_ENV=production rake gems:install

= Syntax Coloring for code listings

Syntax coloring can be performed on code listings that occur in your articles
by surrounding them with <macro:code lang="ruby">...</macro:code> tags.  
However, for this to work, your theme must provide CodeRay css styles.  If 
you use the <macro:code> tags and don't see syntax coloring then the CodeRay
styles may be added to your current theme by customizing the theme as follows:

1.  Login to Admin (http://localhost:3000/admin) 
2.  Select 'Design' tab
3.  Click 'layout.liquid' in the list of templates in the right margin
4.  In the textfield, scroll to the bottom of the {% head %}...{% endhead %}
    section and insert the following 2 stylesheet link tags:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/plugin_assets/filtered_column_code_macro/default_codemacro.css" type="text/css" media="screen" charset="utf-8">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/plugin_assets/filtered_column_code_macro/default_coderay.css" type="text/css" media="screen" charset="utf-8">

These stylesheets will not only add syntax coloring - but also wrap the code 
listings with a div that will automatically add a horizontal scrollbar and 
dynamically adjust the width of the code listing to fit your layout.  You may 
want to update existing themes which already support syntax coloring to use 
these new default stylesheets since existing themes usually only display code
listings using a static width.
